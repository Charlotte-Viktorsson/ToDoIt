# Assignment3 ToDoIt
## The ToDoIt - the comand line version.

This is the third assignment we got for the .Net Core C# course.
Two persons used GitHub to collaborate on the project. We do not make any claims for best solution or best practice. Allthough we have been trying to keep the solution as readable and code friendly as we could.
The Objectivces was to learn about Arrays, OOP, Encapsulation, Relations between objects (aggregation and Composition), Testing using xUnit, Agile Workflow and Collaboration.
The code do not use much in-line comments, but uses the Visual Studio documentation of methods.
Also take a look at the Class Diagram based on UML for an overview of the classes.

Please take a look at the work, and I hope you can enjoy it!
